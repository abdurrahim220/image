# ImageAiApp — Technical Project Review

## Project Summary

ImageAiApp is a modern, full-stack web application designed for advanced image manipulation using generative AI. Built with Next.js 14, TypeScript, and MongoDB, it enables users to restore, fill, remove objects, recolor, and remove backgrounds from images. The platform features authentication, credit-based usage, and seamless payment integration, making it suitable for both casual and professional users.

## Architecture & Structure

- **Frontend (Next.js 14, TypeScript)**: Modular pages and components for image transformation, user profile, credits, and authentication.
- **Backend (Node.js, MongoDB)**: API routes for user, image, and transaction management, with webhooks for Clerk (auth) and Stripe (payments).
- **Authentication**: Clerk integration supporting Google and GitHub login.
- **Payment**: Stripe integration for purchasing credits.
- **AI Image Processing**: Cloudinary AI for generative image transformations via natural language prompts.
- **State Management**: React hooks and server actions for seamless UX.
- **Validation**: Zod for form and API validation.

## Features & Implementation

- **Image Transformations**: Five core features—Restore, Generative Fill, Object Remove, Object Recolor, Background Remove.
- **Credit System**: Users receive free credits on signup; each transformation deducts credits. Additional credits can be purchased via Stripe.
- **User Management**: Profile page displays credit balance and transformation history. Users can update or delete images.
- **Authentication**: Secure login via Clerk (Google/GitHub), with user metadata managed via webhooks.
- **Payment & Transactions**: Stripe checkout for credit packages; transaction history managed in MongoDB.
- **Error Handling**: Centralized error handler for API and UI errors.
- **Responsive UI**: Built with chadcn/ui and Tailwind CSS for a modern, mobile-friendly experience.
